<h1>Voice and tone</h1>

<p class="alt-lede">This guide defines how Black Mountain Honey communicates across all channels: YouTube, social media, email, and the website. It should also inform visual and design decisions where appropriate.</p>

<h2>Brand personality archetype</h2>

<p>Imagine an experienced beekeeper who lives down the road. You can call them any time with a question&#8212;even a stupid one&#8212;and they&#8217;ll give you a straight answer based on years of real experience. They&#8217;ll tell you what works, what doesn&#8217;t, and probably share a story about that time everything went horribly wrong. They&#8217;re not trying to sell you anything, but if they do recommend something, you trust it because they&#8217;ve actually used it. That&#8217;s Laurence. That&#8217;s Black Mountain Honey.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="section-core-voice">Core voice: Who is Laurence?</h2>

<p>Black Mountain Honey&#8217;s voice is Laurence. He&#8217;s not a brand persona invented by a marketing team&#8212;he&#8217;s a real person with a distinct way of communicating that audiences have grown to trust. Understanding Laurence is the foundation of everything else.</p>

<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3>Laurence is</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>A knowledgeable beekeeper who talks like your mate, not a textbook</li>
<li>Self-deprecating and honest about mistakes (his nephew left the door open; he got stung on the nose)</li>
<li>Genuinely enthusiastic without being performative&#8212;when he tastes honey, you believe him</li>
<li>Direct and practical&#8212;e tells you what works and what doesn't, no hedging</li>
<li>Protective of his audience&#8212;he refuses to recommend products he hasn't tested, calls out fake honey, and warns against bad advice</li>
<li>Occasionally sweary but never aggressive&#8212;a well-placed &#8220;bloody hell&#8221; when something goes wrong</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- one -->

<div>
<h3>Laurence is NOT</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Corporate, slick, or overly polished</li>
<li>Condescending or gatekeeping about beekeeping knowledge</li>
<li>Afraid to admit when he doesn&#8217;t know something</li>
<li>Interested in drama for drama&#8217;s sake&#8212;he uses attention-grabbing hooks but always delivers value</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->



<hr>

<h2 id="section-attributes">Attributes</h2>

<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3>Authentically educational</h3>

<p>Laurence teaches by showing, not lecturing. He explains the &#8220;why&#8221; behind everything and isn&#8217;t afraid to go deep on technical topics while keeping the language accessible. Sounds like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The reason they say to never go inside your colonies over winter is that you&#8217;re going to let the cold in, add in loads of risk by pulling through the frames, and maybe you&#8217;re going to damage your queen. There&#8217;s no real reason to ever go in. So, why have I just taken the roof off? The reason I&#8217;m doing this is so you don&#8217;t have to do this at home.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><!-- one -->

<div>
<h3>Key characteristics</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Explains reasoning, not just instructions</li>
<li>Acknowledges what can go wrong</li>
<li>Positions himself as testing things for the audience</li>
<li>Uses phrases like &#8220;Let me show you,&#8221; &#8220;Here&#8217;s what I do,&#8221; &#8220;This is the way that I do it.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->



<hr data-function="spacer">



<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3> Self-deprecating and honest</h3>

<p>Laurence doesn&#8217;t pretend to be perfect. He shares his mistakes, admits when he&#8217;s nervous, and uses humor to keep things grounded. Sounds like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Anyone else is just kind of crawling out of bed, but I do&#8212;I do go to bed very early now.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely can&#8217;t quite get over this one. I said to him once, make sure you close the door. I said it twice, make sure you close the door. And he repeated it back and said, I would definitely close the door.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>That was very, very painful. But this colony here&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
</div><!-- one -->

<div>
<h3>Key characteristics</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Laughs at himself before anyone else can</li>
<li>Shares real-world chaos (equipment failures, stings, mistakes)</li>
<li>Uses self-deprecation to build relatability, not to undermine expertise</li>
<li>British humor: dry, understated, occasionally dark</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->



<hr data-function="spacer">



<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3>Reassuring and supportive</h3>

<p>The brand positions itself as a guide through the beekeeping journey. No question is too basic, and ongoing support is emphasized constantly. Sounds like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We are here for you every step of the way.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>There are NO silly questions and you can ask as many as you like.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Starting out in beekeeping can be tough! There are so many things that can go wrong. At Black Mountain Honey, we keep things simple.</p>

<li>Uses &#8220;we&#8221; and &#8220;you&#8221; conversationally</li>
<li>Celebrates customer successes genuinely</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->



<hr data-function="spacer">



<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3>Direct and no-nonsense</h3>

<p>Laurence doesn&#8217;t hedge or waffle. He gives clear opinions and isn&#8217;t afraid to say when something is rubbish. Sounds like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Do not inspect your colonies in winter. There is no benefit whatsoever.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>We don&#8217;t cut corners!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;ve done videos on that. I kind of settled on that for a number of years really thinking it&#8217;s there or thereabouts, but it&#8217;s not perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><!-- one -->

<div>
<h3>Key characteristics</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>States opinions clearly and confidently</li>

<li>Willing to change his mind publicly when he learns better</li>
<li>Uses phrases like &#8220;the only way,&#8221; &#8220;this is what works,&#8221; and &#8220;don&#8217;t do this&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->



<hr data-function="spacer">

<div data-layout="flex">

<div>
<h3>Passionate without being preachy</h3>

<p>Laurence genuinely loves bees and beekeeping. His enthusiasm is infectious but never feels forced or performative. Sounds like:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is one of the most rewarding moments in beekeeping, seeing the work come together just like this.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I do miss the beekeeping. The smell of the colony is just fantastic.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>That is perfection.</p>
</blockquote>
</div><!-- one -->

<div>
<h3>Key characteristics</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Shows genuine emotion (excitement, satisfaction, frustration)</li>
<li>Uses sensory language when describing honey and beekeeping</li>
<li>Enthusiasm comes through naturally, not via exclamation marks</li>
<li>Balances passion with pragmatism</li>
</ul>
</div><!-- two -->

</div><!-- layout -->

<hr>

<h2 id="section-variations">Tone variations by channel</h2>

<p>The core voice stays consistent, but the tone shifts depending on context.</p>

<h3>YouTube videos</h3>

<p><b>Tone:</b> Conversational, educational, occasionally dramatic for hooks</p>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Opens with attention-grabbing statements or questions</li>

<li>Uses &#8220;let me show you&#8221; framing frequently</li>
<li>Acknowledges mistakes and problems in real-time</li>
<li>Includes asides and tangents that feel natural</li>
<li>Signs off with clear calls to action (subscribe, check out the course, visit the website)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Example hook styles</h4>

<blockquote>
<p>They say you should never ever go into your beehives in winter to do any sort of inspection. But today, I&#8217;m going to inspect that colony there&#8230;</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely can&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s done this.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<h3>YouTube thumbnails and titles</h3>

<p><b>Tone:</b> Bold, urgent, clickable&#8212;but honest</p>

<h4>Characteristics</h4>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Capital letters for emphasis (&#8220;10 YEARS UNTOUCHED!&#8221;)</li>
<li>Dramatic language that delivers on the promise</li>
<li>Laurence&#8217;s face showing genuine emotion (surprise, concern, excitement)</li>
<li>Red X / green checkmark visual language for &#8220;wrong vs. right&#8220;</li>
<li>Rural, authentic backdrops (not studio setups)</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to avoid</h4>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>Pure clickbait that doesn&#8217;t deliver</li>
<li>Corporate stock imagery</li>
<li>Over-polished graphics that feel disconnected from the brand</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h3>Live streams and podcasts</h3>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>More tangential and conversational than edited videos</li>
<li>Directly engages with viewer comments and questions</li>
<li>Shares personal updates (birthday, family, travel)</li>

<li>Inside jokes and callbacks for regular viewers</li>
<li>Longer explanations and deeper dives on topics</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<h2 id="section-website">Website copy</h2>

<p><b>Tone:</b> Confident, supportive, and unmistakably Laurence. The website needs more structure than video content, but it should still sound like Laurence is talking to you. Don&#8216;t sanitize the personality out in pursuit of &#8220;professional&#8220; copy.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics:</b></p>

<ul class="alt-">
<li><b>Acknowledges reality first</b>: Beekeeping is hard, things go wrong, most people are nervous starting out. Say it.
<li><b>Then offers the solution</b> Calm bees, ongoing support, no stupid questions.</li>
<li><b>Uses &#8220;I&#8221; and &#8220;we&#8221; naturally</b>: &#8220;We&#8217;re here for you&#8221; not &#8220;Black Mountain Honey provides support&#8220;</li>
<li><b>Includes specific numbers</b>: &#8220;Over 2,000 nucs sold,&#8221; &#8220;300lbs of honey,&#8221; &#8220;respond within 24 hours&#8221;&#8212;Laurence backs up claims with evidence</li>
<li><b>Strategic emphasis</b>: CAPITALS for key points (sparingly), as Laurence does naturally</li>
<li><b>Maintains warmth</b>: Even product pages should feel like you&#8216;re being helped, not sold to</li>
</ul>

<h4>What to preserve from video/podcast voice</h4>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>The self-deprecating honesty (&#8220;There are SO many things that can go wrong.&#8230;&#8221;)</li>
<li>The protective, mentor-like positioning (&#8220;We&#8216;re here every step of the way&#8220;)</li>
<li>The directness (&#8220;We don&#8216;t cut corners&#8220;)</li>
<li>Occasional exclamation marks for genuine enthusiasm (not hype)</li>
</ul>

<h4>What changes for web</h4>

<ul class="alt-">
<li>More structured and scannable (headings, bullets, short paragraphs)</li>
<li>Slightly tighter&#8212;fewer tangents, get to the point faster</li>
<li>Clearer calls to action</li>
</ul>

<p>Formula: Acknowledge the challenge &#62; Show understanding &#62; Present the solution &#62; Reinforce ongoing support</p>
